# Python client for kdb+

The PyKX interface exposes q as a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded within Python, and also permits IPC connectivity to kdb+ from Python applications.

PyKX supports three principal use cases:

1. It allows users to store, query, manipulate and use q objects within a Python process.
2. It allows users to query external q processes via an IPC interface.
3. It allows users to embed Python functionality within a native q session using it's under q functionality.

It is documented and available for download from [https://code.kx.com/pykx](https://code.kx.com/pykx).
