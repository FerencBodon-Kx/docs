# Starting kdb+

This is a quick-start guide to kdb+, aimed primarily at those learning independently. It covers system installation, the kdb+ environment, IPC, tables and typical databases, and where to find more material. After completing this you should be able to follow the Borror textbook [Q for Mortals](/q4m3/), and the [Reference](../../ref/index.md).

One caution: you can learn kdb+ reasonably well by independent study, but for serious deployment of the product you need the help of a consultant. This is because kdb+ is typically used for very demanding applications that require experience to set up properly. Contact KX for help with such evaluations.

## kdb+

The kdb+ system is both a database and a programming language.
  
-   **kdb+**: the database (_k database plus_)
-   **q**: a general-purpose programming language integrated with kdb+


## Resources

-   a [Reference](../../ref/index.md) for the built-in functions
-   [interfaces](../../interfaces/index.md) with other languages and processes

### Discussion groups

-   The main discussion forum is the [k4 Topicbox](https://k4.topicbox.com/groups/k4). This is available only to licensed customers – please use a work email address to [apply for access](https://k4.topicbox.com/groups/k4?subscription_form=e1ca20f8-95f6-11e8-8090-9973fa3f0106).
-   [KX Community discussion forum](https://learninghub.kx.com/forums/) is used to find answers, ask questions, and connect with our KX Community.


## :fontawesome-solid-download: Install free system

If you do not already have access to a licensed copy, go to [Get started](../index.md) to download and install q.


## Graphical user interface

When q is run, it displays a console where you can enter commands and see the results. This is all you need to follow the tutorial, and if you just want to learn a little about q, then it is easiest to work in the console.

As you become more familiar with q, you may prefer to work in the interactive development environment [**KX Developer**](/developer/). ([_Kx Analyst_](/analyst/) is the enterprise version of Developer.)
